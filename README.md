## Gameplay and Controls

### Gameplay
The objective of the game is to eat as many apples as possible. With each apple consumed, the snake's length increases by 1. That sounds easy! However, the game gets harder as more apples are consumed. If the snakes bumps into itself, it's game over. Additionally, skulls scattered across the field cause negative consequences, but powerups sometimes appear to help out.

An extra green skull is added for each apple consumed, whereas gray skulls are less frequent. Powerups that are not picked up disappear if an apple is consumed! 

#### Skulls
